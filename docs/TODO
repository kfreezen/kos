Create a devfs to allow for printing to files such as stdout --

0.7.0 features:

Do testing of the floppy driver and the FAT12 VFS driver
	by loading a >2KB text file into memory and printing
	it to the screen. --

Add relocation support to the ELF parser.

Add a semi-syscall kernel mode interrupt to allow the external
	drivers to set themselves up.  Documentation for this
	should be in docs/KernelDriverInterruptDoc

Add a "filename beautifier" to the FAT12 driver for those cases
	where a long file name entry is not available.  This
	filename beautifier should replace the spaces with a dot
	as well as put the filenames into lowercase in the VFS.

0.7.1 features
Add initrd support to allow for more configurability when it
	comes to installs
